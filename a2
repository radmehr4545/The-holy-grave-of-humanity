#### **II. Reconstructed Synthesis Pathway**

The chemical signatures present are consistent with the processing of coca leaf into cocaine hydrochloride, utilizing a multi-stage extraction and purification process common in clandestine jungle laboratories. The presence of levamisole and phenacetin indicates post-production cutting to increase bulk and potentiate stimulatory effects.

**Step 1: Primary Leaf Processing and Alkalinization**
*   **Ingredients:** Dried coca leaves (*Erythroxylum coca*), calcium carbonate (powdered limestone) or sodium carbonate (soda ash), water.
*   **Process:** Dried coca leaves are finely pulverized. The leaf powder is mixed with a solution of water and a weak base (carbonate). The alkaline environment hydrolyzes the cocaine alkaloids from their natural state into freebase cocaine (cocaine base), making them more soluble in non-polar solvents. The mixture is worked into a damp, malleable paste.

**Step 2: Solvent Extraction of Cocaine Base**
*   **Ingredients:** Coca paste, kerosene (or gasoline, diesel fuel), sulfuric acid, water.
*   **Process:** The alkaline coca paste is combined with the hydrocarbon solvent in a large drum or pit. The mixture is aggressively stirred and trampled, dissolving the freebase cocaine into the kerosene. The aqueous leaf slurry and kerosene layer are allowed to separate. The kerosene layer, now containing the dissolved cocaine, is drained off. A dilute solution of sulfuric acid in water is added to the kerosene. The acid converts the freebase cocaine into water-soluble cocaine sulfate, pulling it from the solvent into the aqueous layer. This acidic, cocaine-rich aqueous solution is separated from the spent kerosene.

**Step 3: Re-precipitation of Crude Cocaine Base**
*   **Ingredients:** Cocaine sulfate solution, sodium carbonate or ammonia hydroxide.
*   **Process:** A strong base (sodium carbonate or ammonia) is slowly added to the acidic cocaine sulfate solution. This neutralizes the acid and causes the cocaine to revert to its freebase form. As an insoluble solid, it precipitates out of the solution as a coarse, granular material known as "coca base" or "pasta base." This material is filtered out using cloth filters and pressed to remove excess water.

**Step 4: Oxidation Purification (The "Permanganate Step")**
*   **Ingredients:** Crude coca base, potassium permanganate (KMnO₄), water, sulfuric acid.
*   **Process:** The crude coca base is re-dissolved in a dilute sulfuric acid solution. A carefully measured solution of potassium permanganate is added. This oxidation reaction specifically targets and degrades undesirable alkaloid impurities (primarily cis-cinnamoylcocaine) without significantly damaging the cocaine molecule. The reaction is tightly controlled by temperature and pH. The resulting precipitate of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) and degraded impurities is filtered out, leaving a purified solution of cocaine sulfate.

**Step 5: Final Basification and Drying of Cocaine Base**
*   **Ingredients:** Purified cocaine sulfate solution, ammonia hydroxide.
*   **Process:** Ammonia hydroxide is added to the purified solution to re-precipitate the cocaine as a purified freebase. This product, often called "cracked base," is of higher purity and has a brighter color. It is filtered and dried, forming a clumpy, off-white to light beige solid.

**Step 6: Conversion to Cocaine Hydrochloride Salt**
*   **Ingredients:** Purified cocaine base, acetone or ether, hydrochloric acid (HCl).
*   **Process:** The dried cocaine base is dissolved in a minimal amount of acetone. Dilute hydrochloric acid is added dropwise to the solution, carefully controlling the pH to avoid decomposition. This converts the freebase into its stable, water-soluble hydrochloride salt. The cocaine hydrochloride precipitates out as a fine white powder. It is filtered, often through a vacuum funnel, and washed with cold acetone to remove final traces of acid and impurities.

**Step 7: Post-Production Adulteration ("Cutting")**
*   **Ingredients:** Cocaine hydrochloride, levamisole, phenacetin, mannitol, inositol.
*   **Process:** The pure cocaine hydrochloride is mechanically mixed with adulterants. Levamisole, a veterinary anti-parasitic agent, is added to potentiate the stimulant effects and complicate toxicology screens. Phenacetin, a banned analgesic, is added to mimic the numbing sensation of pure cocaine. Diluents like mannitol and inositol are added to increase the powder's volume and weight for retail sale. The mixture is then mechanically compressed into bricks for transportation.
